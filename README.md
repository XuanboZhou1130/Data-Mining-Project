### Non-Technical Summary

#### Project Background and Problem Statement

This project aims to analyze and clean HIV/AIDS prevalence data in order to identify trends, make predictions, and provide actionable insights. The dataset contains statistics on HIV/AIDS prevalence, the number of affected people, and annual deaths in various countries, spanning multiple years. The goal is to clean and analyze this data to better understand the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and its impact.

#### Data and Methods

The data used in this project comes from publicly available HIV/AIDS prevalence estimates across different countries. Initially, we performed data cleaning to handle issues such as missing values, inconsistencies in formatting, and extreme outliers. We then applied several statistical techniques and machine learning methods to extract insights and make predictions.

Key methods include:

* **Data Cleaning:** Standardizing country names, converting percentage values to decimals, and removing outliers.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify trends and relationships, such as the correlation between HIV prevalence and death rates.
* **Clustering Analysis:** Grouping countries based on HIV/AIDS metrics to identify high-risk regions.
* **Regression Models:** Predicting annual deaths based on HIV prevalence using different machine learning models.

#### Model Performance

The machine learning models evaluated in this project include:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regression**
3. **XGBoost Regression**

The models were tested on a hold-out dataset, with evaluation metrics like **R² Score** (which indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data) and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** (which measures the model's prediction error). Among the models tested, **XGBoost** performed the best, providing accurate predictions with the lowest RMSE and highest R² score.

#### Findings and Recommendations

* **High-Risk Countries:** Countries with high HIV prevalence (e.g., Eswatini, Lesotho, and Botswana) are significantly more likely to experience higher annual deaths from HIV/AIDS.
* **Trends Over Time:** The data shows a decreasing trend in HIV prevalence in some countries, but more needs to be done globally to combat the epidemic.
* **Key Variables:** The analysis suggests that adult HIV prevalence is strongly correlated with the number of deaths, and this factor should be prioritized in future interventions and health policies.

**Future Improvements:**

* Expanding the dataset with more recent information would allow for better trend analysis.
* Incorporating additional features (e.g., healthcare access, government spending on HIV/AIDS prevention) could improve the accuracy of predictions.
